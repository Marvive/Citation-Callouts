# Logos Callout Paste Plugin

An Obsidian plugin that detects content from Logos Bible Software and formats it as beautiful callouts when pasting.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Detects when you're pasting content from Logos Bible Software by checking for `https://ref.ly/logosres` URLs
- **Smart Book Name Extraction**: Automatically extracts the book name from your citation
- **Beautiful Callouts**: Creates formatted callouts with the Logos icon and book name
- **Easy Access**: Use the command palette, ribbon icon, or keyboard shortcut

## Usage

1. Copy content from Logos Bible Software that includes a citation with a `https://ref.ly/logosres` URL
2. In Obsidian, use one of these methods:
   - **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + P` and search for "Paste as Logos Callout"
   - **Ribbon Icon**: Click the book icon in the sidebar
   - **Right-click**: Use the context menu (if available)

### Example

**From Logos (copied to clipboard):**
```
"Harnack defined Christianity as ''a very simple but very sublime thing: To live in time and for eternity _under the eye of God_ and by His help.''
